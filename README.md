# VPD-Data-Analysis
## Overview
In this project, I looked at VPD data, Housing Market Data, and Census Data to compare crime rates among different neighbourhoods in Vancouver to see the overview of which neighbourhood seems to have the most crime and what type of crime is being committed the most in that area.
## Problem Statement 
How can the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) reduce crime rates by identifying socioeconomic factors involving income levels, education and employment.
## Analytical Questions
AQ 1) What is the relationship between household income levels and types of crimes in specific neighborhoods? 
AQ 2) Is there a correlation between unemployment rates and specific types of crime in various neighborhoods? 
AQ 3) How does educational attainment in households correlate with crime rates across neighborhoods? 
AQ 4) Are there seasonal or monthly trends in crime rates associated with occurrence of crime (e.g., during holiday seasons)? 
AQ 5) What form of relationship exists between housing availability and crime rates?
